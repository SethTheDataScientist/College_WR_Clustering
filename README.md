# College_WR_Clustering
Welcome! This is my attempt to quantify playstyles of College Wide Weceivers before they enter the NFL. I was inspired by PFF's Kevin Cole and his work on clustering NFL Wide Receivers, and used that basic framework to recreate it for College Players.

The Values are Normalized and are shown using a radar chart. The values being measured are 
RR - Routes Run
TPRR - Targets per Route Run
YPRR - Yards per Route Run
TDPRR - Touchdowns per Route Run
ADOT - Average Depth of Target
YPC - Yards per Catch

These measures give an overview of efficiency, volume, and usage down the field for a given Receiver relative to their College Peers from 2019-2021. 
The ideal case is to have the entire chart filled in becuase then you are doing everything at a high level. 
I will link Kevin's article below that goes into more detail about the different valuations of each cluster for further review.
